# Hi, I'm Kyle! ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a Full-Stack Software Engineer at [Dynameyes](https://www.dynameyes.dev/), building web apps using VueJS (TypeScript) and Django ([GraphQL using Graphene](https://docs.graphene-python.org/)).

I'm also a hobbyist developer, doing random personal projects such as websites, apps, or even small scripts that may help you.
